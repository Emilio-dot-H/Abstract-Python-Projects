# Abstract-Python-Projects

## Purpose
This is a list of practical and impractical python projects that are used to refine my Python skills and expand my knowledge. Multiple side-projects have stemmed from the skeleton of these current projects. This is more or less a portfolio of my Python expertise. Many of these projects are inspired and guided by the book: 'Impractical Python Projects' by Lee Vaughan.
