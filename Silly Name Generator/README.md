## PigLatin

**Problem Statement:** To form Pig Latin, you take an English word that begins with a consonant, move that consonant to the end, and then add “ay” to the end of the word. If the word begins with a vowel, you simply add “way” to the end of the word. One of the most famous Pig Latin phrases of all time is “ixnay on the ottenray,” uttered by Marty Feldman in Mel Brooks’s comedic masterpiece Young Frankenstein.

Write a program that takes a word as input and uses indexing and slicing to return its Pig Latin equivalent. Run Pylint and pydocstyle on your code and correct any style mistakes. You can find a solution in the appendix or download pig_latin_practice.py from https://www.nostarch.com/impracticalpython/.
